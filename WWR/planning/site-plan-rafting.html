    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      WASP-19 is a magnitude 12.3 star located in the Vela constellation of the southern hemisphere.
      This star has been found to host a transiting hot Jupiter-type planet in tight orbit.
      The WASP-19 is older than Sun, has fraction of heavy elements above solar abundance, 
      and is rotating rapidly, being spun up by the tides raised by the giant planet on the close orbit 
      (pulled from wikipedia)
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Our sun will explode it is only a matter of when it will explode or go supernova for a more correct term 
      and we cannot stop it, at least not with the technology we currently have.
    </p>
