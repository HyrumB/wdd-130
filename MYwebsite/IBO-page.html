                                frames BARBATOS came into the hands of a paramilitary organization known as CGS (Chryse
                                Guard Security) who proceeded to just use it as a generator for their main base. But
                                after a revolt from the “employees”, who rebranded the company to Tekkadan (or Iron
                                Flower Brigade), they began to use the Gundam frame known as BARBATOS to its full
                                potential. It also is later upgraded to the BARBATOS LUPIS and finally gets upgraded to
                                BARBATOS LUPIS REX
