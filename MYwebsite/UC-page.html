                                A group on a space colony who call themselves Zeon begin construction of a mobile suit
                                known as the Zaku, after they completed the Zaku and mass-produce it, they went to war
                                with the federation over their want for independence from the Earth Federation. After
                                seeing the Zaku’s performance the Earth Federation began V-Project which was to make 3
                                RX-78 units which were to be constructed inside one of the space colonies known as side
                                7 so Zeon wouldn't find the new mobile suits but before they could all be completed a
                                group of Zeon’s Zaku mobile suits began an attack on the civilian colony where all the
                                Gundams except the RX-78-02 Gundam were destroyed. The RX-78-02 and its new pilot 16
                                year old Amuro Ray managed to push back the Zakus raid and left the damaged side 7 on
                                the new ship the Trojan Horse which was also constructed as part of V-Project. They make
                                their way to the Earth Federation’s main base on earth to deliver the RX-78-02 for mass
                                production. It is also instrumental in the defeat of Zeon as a whole.

                                Produced as the final part of the E.F.S.F's(Earth Federation Space Force) reorganization
                                plan, known as the "UC Project", the Unicorn Gundam was to be the symbol of the plan's
                                final goal to remove all traces of Zeonism as such in its alternate mode(not pictured)
                                it holds an appearance similar to the RX-78-02. But the project was taken over by the
                                Vist Foundation they added a “LA+ Program” OS to the unicorn Gundam making it the key to
                                finding Laplace's Box which could severely harm the Earth Federation’s current
                                administration. As the box contain’s the original charter for the Universal Century.
                                After a successful test flight near the colony industrial 7. A group known as the
                                sleeves who are remnants of the Second Neo Zeon Movement begin a conflict with Londo
                                bell who are the E.F.S.F special forces. In the ensuing battle, the test Unicorn’s test
                                pilot is gravely injured and after a short conversation about life, he gives it to
                                Banagher Links making him the only person capable of piloting the unicorn Gundam through

                                A terrorist organization known as Mafty stole the XI Gundam aka (Ξ Gundam) while being
                                transported from Anaheim Electronics' factory on the Moon to Halmahera, Indonesia on
                                Earth the group then used it during an attack on the Earth Federation’s leaders during a
                                conference in Australia, where it showed better performance to that of the RX-104FF
                                Penelope which the XI Gundam and its pilot the leader of Mafty, Mafty Navue Erin
                                defeated. But the pilot of the RX-104FF Penelope a man named Lane Aime learned from his
                                fight with Mafty and during his second fight defeated Mafty through the use of beam
                                barrier traps which he lured the XI Gundam into. The traps knocked Mafty Navue Erin aka
                                Hathaway Noa (son of the captain of the Trojan Horse) unconscious and allowed the Circe
                                unit, which Lane Aime was a member of, to arrest him. The XI Gundam’s wreckage was later
                                retrieved by the Federation Forces.
