      So where do you begin with Gundam in my opinion there are two choices 1) start at the beginning which
      would be the UC timeline that the original Gundam tv show/movies I suggest the movies as they hold
      the same content as the tv show but it has been streamlined (and slightly remastered) to only be the
      necessary content and after the original 3 Gundam movies you can watch Gundam origins to gain some
      context to it or you could watch Gundam origin and then the original 3 Gundam movies or 2) you could
      start with IBO or Iron Blooded Orphans which is not connected to any other timeline at the time of my
      writing this so it makes it a great entry point. Or you can look at the image below and pick your
      own starting point

      During an event only known as the calamity war, an organization known as Gjallarhorn
      built 72 Gundam frames to put an end to the war. Which they did but in the process but 8
      known Gundam frames were lost from Gjallarhorn's possession one of the lost Gundam
      frames BARBATOS came into the hands of a paramilitary organization known as CGS (Chryse
      Guard Security) who proceeded to just use it as a generator for their main base. But
      after a revolt from the “employees”, who rebranded the company to Tekkadan (or Iron
      Flower Brigade), they began to use the Gundam frame known as BARBATOS to its full
      potential. It also is later upgraded to the BARBATOS LUPIS and finally gets upgraded to
      BARBATOS LUPIS REX

      but 8 known Gundam frames were lost from Gjallarhorn's possession one of the lost Gundam
      frames known as the GUSON, a heavily armored frame with two Ahab reactors to maintain
      its mobility, it was found by a group of pirates in the middle of a hard to navigate
      space debris zone after being claimed it was passed from pirate group to pirate group
      until it was given to a group of pirates known as the brewers, who in their second
      conflict with the group Tekkadan. The brewers proceed to lose the battle, and the GUSON
      then fell into the hands of Tekkadan who after some deliberation renamed it to the GUSON
      REBAKE. And it was later upgraded to the GUSON REBAKE FULL-CITY

      known as the FLAUROS which was abandoned after being buried in a mine with one of the
      mobile
      armors (Hashmal) they were built to fight, and there it sat until Tekkadan unearthed
      both
      the mobile armor Hashmal and the FLAUROS they sent the FLAUROS off to be repaired and
      after
      its repair, it was instrumental in the defeat of the accidentally reawakened Hashmal.
      The
      pilot of the FLAUROS also refers to it as the Ryusei-Go.

    <h3>UC-timeline</h3>

      A group on a space colony who call themselves Zeon begin construction of a mobile suit
      known as the Zaku, after they completed the Zaku and mass-produce it, they went to war
      with the federation over their want for independence from the Earth Federation. After
      seeing the Zaku’s performance the Earth Federation began V-Project which was to make 3
      RX-78 units which were to be constructed inside one of the space colonies known as side
      7 so Zeon wouldn't find the new mobile suits but before they could all be completed a
      group of Zeon’s Zaku mobile suits began an attack on the civilian colony where all the
      Gundams except the RX-78-02 Gundam were destroyed. The RX-78-02 and its new pilot 16
      year old Amuro Ray managed to push back the Zakus raid and left the damaged side 7 on
      the new ship the Trojan Horse which was also constructed as part of V-Project. They make
      their way to the Earth Federation’s main base on earth to deliver the RX-78-02 for mass
      production. It is also instrumental in the defeat of Zeon as a whole.
      /////
      Produced as the final part of the E.F.S.F's(Earth Federation Space Force) reorganization
      plan, known as the "UC Project", the Unicorn Gundam was to be the symbol of the plan's
      final goal to remove all traces of Zeonism as such in its alternate mode(not pictured)
      it holds an appearance similar to the RX-78-02. But the project was taken over by the
      Vist Foundation they added a “LA+ Program” OS to the unicorn Gundam making it the key to
      finding Laplace's Box which could severely harm the Earth Federation’s current
      administration. As the box contain’s the original charter for the Universal Century.
      After a successful test flight near the colony industrial 7. A group known as the
      sleeves who are remnants of the Second Neo Zeon Movement begin a conflict with Londo
      bell who are the E.F.S.F special forces. In the ensuing battle, the test Unicorn’s test
      pilot is gravely injured and after a short conversation about life, he gives it to
      Banagher Links making him the only person capable of piloting the unicorn Gundam through
      biometric autherisation.
      ////
      A terrorist organization known as Mafty stole the XI Gundam aka (Ξ Gundam) while being
      transported from Anaheim Electronics' factory on the Moon to Halmahera, Indonesia on
      Earth the group then used it during an attack on the Earth Federation’s leaders during a
      conference in Australia, where it showed better performance to that of the RX-104FF
      Penelope which the XI Gundam and its pilot the leader of Mafty, Mafty Navue Erin
      defeated. But the pilot of the RX-104FF Penelope a man named Lane Aime learned from his
      fight with Mafty and during his second fight defeated Mafty through the use of beam
      barrier traps which he lured the XI Gundam into. The traps knocked Mafty Navue Erin aka
      Hathaway Noa (son of the captain of the Trojan Horse) unconscious and allowed the Circe
      unit, which Lane Aime was a member of, to arrest him. The XI Gundam’s wreckage was later
      retrieved by the Federation Forces.
